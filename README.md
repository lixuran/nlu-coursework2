To get started, clone the repository:
```bash

```
 The first thing you should do is set up a working Conda environment for your work. The same `requirements.txt` from Coursework 1 is included here. 
```bash
conda create -n nlu --file ./requirements.txt -c pytorch
```
Then, continue following the instructions in the instruction sheet available on Blackboard Learn.
